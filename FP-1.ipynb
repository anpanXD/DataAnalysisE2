    "\n",
    "- The purpose of this project is to analyse incident characteristics, locations, and circumstances around the involved firearm(s) for potential patterns and correlation with participant age. Knowledge of correlations would give governing agencies and other organizations a clearer direction as to what kinds of preventative initiatives should be focused on, as this would likely vary by age group.\n",

    "- They key independent variables (IVs) include:\n",
    "    - The list of incident characteristics\n",
    "    - Age of subject-suspect\n",
    "    - Congressional district\n",
    "    - Description of location where incident took place\n",

The Gun Violence Archive (GVA) is a not-for-profit, independent organization that collects gun violence incidents from 7,500+ sources across law enforcement, media, government, and commercial spheres in an effort to maintain a near-real time online archive. Due to the GVA's downloading limitations, it was sorted and merged by GitHub user [James Ko](https://github.com/jamesqo).\n",
